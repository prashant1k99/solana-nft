# Solana NFT

1. In order to create an NFT, we first create nft collection as done in [create-collection.ts](https://github.com/prashant1k99/solana-nft/blob/main/create-collection.ts)

2. Then we create the NFT, as implemented in [create-nft.ts](https://github.com/prashant1k99/solana-nft/blob/main/create-nft.ts)

3. Now we have created both our NFT and Collection, now we need to verify that the NFT to belongs to the collection. To do that we execute [verify-nft.ts](https://github.com/prashant1k99/solana-nft/blob/main/verify-nft.ts)

And we have successfully created NFT and NFT collection and also verified that the NFT belongs to our collection
